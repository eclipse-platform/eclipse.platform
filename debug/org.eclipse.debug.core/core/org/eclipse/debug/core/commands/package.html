<p>Provides a set of interfaces for common debug commands.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides a set interfaces for common debug commands. A debug command 
  represent a debugger function that can be enabled or disabled and executed. 
  The debug platform provides actions corresponding to the common debug commands. 
  The actions delegate to the command handler interfaces to determine enabled 
  state and execute.</p>
<p>A debugger implementation can provide its own implementation of a command by 
  implementing a command handler interface directly, or by registering an adapter 
  that implements the command handler interface. The debug platform's actions 
  update enabled state and execute based on the active debug context. The debug 
  platform provides implementations of handlers for the common debug commands 
  for debuggers that are an implementation of the standard debug model. For example, 
  the debug platform registers an <code>IStepOverHandler</code> adapter for implementations 
  of <code>IStep</code>.</p>
