<p>Provides a set of interfaces and classes for rendering and annotating text in the debug console.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides a set interfaces and classses for coloring streams of 
  text, parsing output, and creating hyperlinks in the debug console.</p>
<h3>Coloring Console Output</h3>
<p>A process may have standard input, output, and error streams associated with, 
  as defined by <b>org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IProcess</b> 
  and <b>org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IStreamsProxy</b>. 
  When a process is registered with the debug plug-in, a document is created to 
  display the output of that process, and to provide input to the process via 
  the keyboard. A console document is displayed in the Console View. By default, 
  the output, error, and input streams are rendered in colors specified by user 
  preferences.</p>
<p>A client can specialize coloring for a process's streams by defining an <b>IConsoleColorProvider</b> 
  extension (using the <b>org.eclipse.debug.ui.consoleColorProviders</b> 
  extension point). A console color provider is defined for a <i>type</i> of process. 
  A process type is defined by the creator of a process, and is specified on an 
  <b>IProcess</b> via the <b>ATTR_PROCESS_TYPE</b> 
  attribute. When a process is registered with the debug plug-in, a console color 
  provider associated with the process type is instantiated, and connected to 
  the process (<b>IProcess</b>) and a 
  console (<b>IConsole</b>). The console 
  color provider then connects its streams to the console (<b>IConsole</b>), 
  via the console methods <b>connect(IStreamsProxy)</b> 
  and <b>connect(IStreamMonitor, String)</b>. 
  The color provider will then be consulted to provide a color when the console 
  needs to render output from a stream.</p>
<h3>Parsing Console Output</h3>
<p>A client can be notified of output appended to a process's console document, 
  by defining an <b>IConsoleLineTracker</b> 
  extension (using the <b>org.eclipse.debug.ui.consoleLineTrackers</b> 
  extension point). A console line tracker is defined for a <i>type</i> of process. 
  When a process is registered with the debug plug-in, a console document is created 
  for that process, and output is appended to that document. As output is written 
  to the document, each console line tracker extension defined for that process 
  type is notified of output, line by line. This support is most commonly used 
  to annotate output with hyperlinks.</p>
