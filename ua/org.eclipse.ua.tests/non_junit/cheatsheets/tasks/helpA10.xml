         Open the preferences and go to the help/content page. Select the radio button to include help content from a remote infocenter and give it priority. Hit the new button which opens a small and non resizable dialog. Hit F1 in this Add new infocenter dialog. Check that help opens externally and not in a tray.

      <description>
         From the workbench menu select File/New/File and resize the dialog to make it short. The dialog should grow a bit to accommodate the tray, then go back to original size when the tray is closed.
