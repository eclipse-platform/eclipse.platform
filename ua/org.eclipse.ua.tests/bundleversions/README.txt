bundleversions.ods is an open office spreadsheet containing the bundle
versions of every bundle in userassist.map for every release since Eclipse 3.3. 

If as a committer you make a change to a bundle you should determine whether 
it's version number needs to be updated, which will be the case if this is the
first time that a bundle has been updated in a particular release. If you do update 
the bundle version be sure to update the spreadsheet in HEAD only, versions if bundleversions.ods
 in branches are not accurate.
