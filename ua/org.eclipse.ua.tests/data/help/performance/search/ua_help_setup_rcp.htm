<h2>Rich Client Platform (RCP) help</h2>

<p>
The Help system is an <em>optional</em> Rich Client Platform (RCP) component. That
is, it is <em>not</em> part of the minimal RCP, but can be added to it. The following
plug-ins and all of their dependencies, including optional dependencies must be added to the RCP base in order to run the Help system:
</p>

<p>
<br>
org.eclipse.help.ui<br>
org.eclipse.help.webapp<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note</em>: Help contents will only be made available to the user if there is
content available. If there are no topics in the table of contents, the help will
not be available.
