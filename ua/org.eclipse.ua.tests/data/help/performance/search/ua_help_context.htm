<h2>Context-sensitive help</h2>

<p>A focused set of help topics that is related to the current context can be 
shown to users on demand using <b>context-sensitive help</b>. This form of user 
assistance is delivered to users when a platform-specific trigger is activated 
(e.g. F1 key on Windows, Ctrl+F1 on GTK, Help key on Carbon). Until Eclipse 3.1, 
context-sensitive help was presented in infopop windows. Since 3.1, a new Help 
view is the preferred way to deliver context-sensitive information to the user.</p>
<p>Context-sensitive help can be associated with widgets statically using 
context IDs, or dynamically using context providers. The new help view also adds 
dynamic help capability by searching help for topics relevant for the current 
context.</p>
