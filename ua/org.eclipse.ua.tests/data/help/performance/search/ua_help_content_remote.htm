<h2>Remote Help</h2>

<p><b>What is remote help?</b></p>

<p>
The help system provides the ability to retrieve content, not only from plug-ins
installed in the local instance of Eclipse, but also from one or more remote servers running
help in <a href="ua_help_setup_infocenter.htm">infocenter</a> mode. This allows
products to ship without help content and provide it from a server to reduce their
download and install size. It also allows user the ability to include help content
from plug-ins not installed in their environment.
</p>

<p><b>How does remote help work?</b></p>

<p>
Content from the remote help servers is merged seamlessly with the local content. There
will be no difference perceptible to the user other than potential network delays. This
is done by adding a second implementation of <code>AbstractTocProvider</code> called
<code>RemoteTocProvider</code> that supplies the content from the remote help server
alongside the local <code>TocFileProvider</code>. For performance reasons, where both
are available, local content will be supplied rather than remote content.
</p>

<p><b>How do I setup a remote help server?</b></p>

<p>
All you have to do to setup a remote help server is run the help system (version 3.3
or later) in <a href="ua_help_setup_infocenter.htm">infocenter</a> mode.
</p>

<p><b>How do I access a remote help server?</b></p>

<p>
A remote help server can be specified in two ways as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ua_help_setup_preferences.htm#remoteHelp">Product customization</a>: There are 
6 options that can be included in the <code>plugin_customization.ini</code> file to
setup remote help defaults. They are <code>remoteHelpOn</code>, <code>remoteHelpHost</code>,
<code>remoteHelpPath</code>,
<code>remoteHelpPort, remoteHelpName, remoteHelpICEnabled.</code>.
</li>
<li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/help_preferences_content.htm">
Help Content preferences</a>: There is a preference page that allows users to
configure remote help server settings manually.</li>
</ul>
