<h2>Deploying the infocenter as a Web Archive</h2>

<p>Using Eclipse 3.4 or later it is possible to configure the help plugins to be deployed 
as a web archive (war file) which will act as a fully <br>
functioning infocenter. The instructions below assume a Tomcat server has been 
installed, but with minor modifications <br>
these steps should work for any full featured server. <br>
<br>
In your Eclipse installation locate the plugin org.eclipse.help.webapp.&lt;version&gt;.jar 
and copy it to a temporary directory, <br>
unzip the copy into that folder.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the webapp plugin locate the web-archive directory and underneath that 
there will be two directories titled &quot;help&quot; and <br>
&quot;org.eclipse.help.infocenter-feature&quot;.</li>
  <li>Import the org.eclipse.help.infocenter-feature using File-&gt;Import-&gt;Existing 
Project.</li>
  <li>Export org.eclipse.help.infocenter-feature as a deployable feature and set 
the destination to be
web-archive/help/WEB-INF/eclipse in the area where org.eclipse.help.webapp.&lt;version&gt;.jar 
was unzipped.</li>
  <li>Add some documentation plugins to the webapps/help/WEB-INF/eclipse/plugins 
directory.</li>
  <li>Download org.eclipse.equinox.http.servletbridge_&lt;version&gt;.jar and 
  org.eclipse.equinox.servletbridge_&lt;version&gt;.jar from the
  <a href="https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/equinox/">equinox download site</a>. 
  Select a version of Equinox that matches the version of Eclipse you are 
  running to take you to the downloads page.</li>
  <li>Extract servletbridge.jar from org.eclipse.equinox.servletbridge_&lt;version&gt;.jar.</li>
  <li>Add the file servletbridge.jar to the help/WEB-INF/lib directory. You may 
need to create this directory.</li>
  <li>Add the file org.eclipse.equinox.http.servletbridge_&lt;version&gt;.jar to the 
help/WEB-INFeclipse/plugins directory</li>
  <li>At this stage you can create a war file from the help directory or you can 
copy the directory and its contents to the webapps 
folder of your Tomcat installation.</li>
  <li>Start Tomcat and see the help system start up.</li>
</ol>Notes: If you look in the config.ini in the help.war file under directory help/WEB_INF/eclipse/configuration 
you will notice the <br>
line eclipse.product=org.eclipse.productname. If your product has help system 
customizations in a product plugin you can <br>
activate these by changing this line to point to your product plugin.<br>
