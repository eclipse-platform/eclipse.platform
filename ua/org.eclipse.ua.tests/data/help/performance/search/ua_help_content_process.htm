<h2>Processing Help Content</h2>

<p>
The Eclipse help system performs preprocessing on html and xhtml pages to add breadcrumbs 
and JavaScript. The processing is performed by output filter which operate on the output stream. Since Eclipse 3.5 
Eclipse has had an extension point to allow user defined filters to be added. This can be used for example to inject javascript 
into every help page. See the extension point <a href = 
"../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_help_webapp_contentFilter.html"> org.eclipse.help.webapp.contentFilter</a> 
for more information.
