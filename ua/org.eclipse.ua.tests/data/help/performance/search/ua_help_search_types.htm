<h2>Plugging in search engines</h2>

<p>
The new federated information search in Help system uses the notion of <b>search 
engine types</b> and <b>search engines</b>. An engine type is a meta-engine from 
which a number of concrete search engines can be created by parameterization.</p>
<p>New engine types are contributed through the
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_help_ui_searchEngine.html">
org.eclipse.help.ui.searchEngine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.help.ui.searchEngine&quot;&gt;
	&lt;engineType
		scopeFactory=&quot;com.example.xyz.XYZScopeFactory&quot;
		label=&quot;XYZ Search&quot;
		class=&quot;com.example.xyz.search.XYZSearch&quot;
		icon=&quot;icons/etool16/xyzsearch.gif&quot;
		pageClass=&quot;com.example.xyz.search.XYZSearchPage&quot;
		id=&quot;com.example.xyz.XYZSearch&quot;&gt;
		&lt;description&gt;
			Instances of XYZ Search search the XYZ site.
		&lt;/description&gt;
	&lt;/engineType&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
This extension point is used to plug in search participants in the information 
search. Each search engine can be configured individually. When search is 
initiated, each search engine is executed as a background job, and the results 
are collated in the help view immediately under the query. 
<p>Search engines defined here will not automatically show up as federated 
search participants until engine product binding is established, unless <code>
productId</code> attribute is left undefined. For engines that define it, only 
those bound to a particular product will show up when that product is running.
</p>
<p>Search engines can simply compose a URL and provide only one hit containing 
that URL as <code>href</code>. Popular search engines for which API support 
requires license can be plugged in like this. On the other end of the spectrum, 
search engines can communicate with the server and receive individual hits with 
information like label, href, short description, score etc. Local help engine 
can produce hits this way.</p>
<p>Regardless of the search mechanism, engines can provide various search scope 
settings using JFace preference pages. These pages are shown when 'Advanced 
Settings' link is followed from the Help view. In addition to root preference 
pages defined with the engine, additional preference sub-pages can be plugged in 
for more advanced settings. </p>
<p>Scope settings are loaded and stored using <code>IPreferenceStore</code> 
objects. Scope settings for all engines are grouped together under a named <b>
scope set</b>. When first opened, default scope set ('Default') is created, but 
users can define more scope sets and flip between them. </p>
<p>Since federated search support is part of <code>org.eclipse.help.base</code> 
plug-in, a factory is needed to create search scope objects from the data in the 
preference store. Clients that plug in scope preference pages are required to 
plug in scope factories as well. </p>
<p>Engines defined in this extension point do not show up in the UI by default. 
What is shown there is a concrete <b>instance</b> of a search engine that can be 
individually modified. Products can pre-configure the help system with a number 
of instances of the registered engine types, possibly parameterized to perform 
in a desired way. In addition, users can add their own instances of the 
registered engines and configure them to their liking:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>
&lt;engine
	enabled=&quot;true&quot;
	engineTypeId=&quot;com.example.xyz.search.XYZSearch&quot;
	id=&quot;com.example.xyz.XYZSearch&quot;
	label=&quot;XYZ Search&quot;&gt;
&lt;/engine&gt;
&lt;engine
	enabled=&quot;true&quot;
	engineTypeId=&quot;org.eclipse.help.ui.web&quot;
	id=&quot;org.eclipse.sdk.Eclipse&quot;
	label=&quot;%search.Eclipse.label&quot;&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;
		%search.Eclipse.desc
	&lt;/description&gt;
	&lt;param 
		name=&quot;url&quot; 
		value=&quot;http://eclipse.org/search/search.cgi?q={expression}&amp;amp;ul=&amp;amp;ps=20&amp;amp;m=all&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/engine&gt;</pre>
