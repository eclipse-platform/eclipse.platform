<h1>Tests for Remote Sites</h1>

These tests allow you to run the security tests on any help server even if that help system does not
have the tests installed. To test a remote help site first open the page "Setup help path" and enter 
the path of the remote site. Be sure to hit OK. After that each of the pages will contain links which 
will test the site whose path you entered.
