/**
 * A state change tester is used by logical models to communicate the
 * synchronization state of their logical model elements to
 * the lightweight label decorator of a team provider.
 * <p>
 * There are two different types of elements being decorated: those
 * that have a one-to-one mapping to a resource and those that do not.
 * Those that do should adapt to their corresponding resource. Doing
 * so will ensure that label updates occur when the state of that
 * resource changes (i.e. the team provider will generate label updates
 * for those resources and the model can translate them to appropriate
 * label updates of their model elements).
 * <p>
 * For those elements that do not have a one-to-one mapping to resources,
 * the model must do extra work. The purpose of this class is to allow
 * the model to decide when a label update for a logical model element is
 * required and to communicate the dirty state of their logical model
 * elements to the team decorator.
 * <p>
 * Model providers need to re-evaluate the state of a
 * model element whenever a change in the resources occurs by listening
 * to both resource deltas and change events from the team state provider
 * ({@link #getTeamStateProvider()}.
 * <p>
 * Decoration enablement changes and decoration configuration changes
 * are handled by the {@link IDecoratorManager#update(String)} API.
 * A call to this method will result in label changes to all elements.
 * The {@link #isDecorationEnabled(Object)} API on this class can
 * be used to determine if an element will receive team decorations.
 * If decoration is disabled. team state changes on the element can
 * be ignored.
 * <p>
 * Clients may subclass this class.
