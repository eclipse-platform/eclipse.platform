/**
 * <p>Interface for pages that appear in the team history view.</p>
 * <p><em>This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * Clients can instead subclass {@link HistoryPage}.</em></p>
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * Once an Object requests to have its history shown in the History View (through an action or DND), the History View
 * will first try to see if any of the open History Views (there can be multiple Views if some of them are pinned) currently
 * show the requested Object's history. It does this by calling {@link HistoryPage#getInput()} on each IHistoryPage (which is supposed
 * to extend {@link HistoryPage} and comparing the input with the passed in Object. If a History View is found that already contains the Object,
 * it is brought to the front and its history is refreshed (by calling {@link #refresh()}).
 * If no History View already contains the requested Object an <code>IHistoryPage</code> might need to be created if the current <code>IHistoryPage</code>
 * being shown in the History View doesn't know how to display the Object or if there are no <code>IHistoryPage</code>s being shown in the History View.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The History View uses an {@link IHistoryPageSource#createPage(Object)} to create the <code>IHistoryPage</code>. If the History View can
 * determine what the Repository Provider is for the dropped Object (i.e. the Object is an instance of {@link IResource}), then it will try
 * to get the {@link IFileHistoryProvider} for the Repository Provider by calling {@link RepositoryProvider#getFileHistoryProvider()}. If no
 * <code>IFileHistoryProvider</code> is returned, the History View will try to adapt the Repository Provider to a <code>IFileHistoryProvider</code>.
 * If the Object whose history is being requested is not an {@link IResource}, it will not be possible to retrieve the Repository Provider from it.
 * In these instances the History View will try to adapt the Object to an {@link IHistoryPageSource}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once the <code>IHistoryPage</code> is created, {@link IHistoryPage#setInput(Object)} is called; this is handled by {@link HistoryPage} which clients
 * should subclass for their own <code>IHistoryPage</code> implementations. <code>HistoryPage</code> will in turn call {@link HistoryPage#inputSet()} -
 * which clients can use for setting up their <code>IHistoryPage</code>. The old page in the History View (along with its {@link SubActionBars} is disposed  -
 * {@link HistoryPage#dispose()} gets called; interested clients can supply a <code>dispose()</code> method in their subclass. Finally, the new page is shown
 * and its SubActionBars are activated.
 * </p>
