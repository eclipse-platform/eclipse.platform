/**
 * The abstract superclass of all plug-in runtime class implementations. A
 * plug-in subclasses this class and overrides the appropriate life cycle
 * methods in order to react to the life cycle requests automatically issued by
 * the platform. For compatibility reasons, the methods called for those life
 * cycle events vary, please see the "Constructors and life cycle methods"
 * section below.
 *
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, the plug-in runtime class represents the entire plug-in rather
 * than an implementation of any one particular extension the plug-in declares.
 * A plug-in is not required to explicitly specify a plug-in runtime class; if
 * none is specified, the plug-in will be given a default plug-in runtime object
 * that ignores all life cycle requests (it still provides access to the
 * corresponding plug-in descriptor).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the case of more complex plug-ins, it may be desirable to define a
 * concrete subclass of <code>Plugin</code>. However, just subclassing
 * <code>Plugin</code> is not sufficient. The name of the class must be
 * explicitly configured in the plug-in's manifest (<code>plugin.xml</code>)
 * file with the class attribute of the <code>&lt;plugin&gt;</code> element
 * markup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of plug-in runtime classes are automatically created by the
 * platform in the course of plug-in activation. For compatibility reasons, the
 * constructor used to create plug-in instances varies, please see the
 * "Constructors and life cycle methods" section below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The concept of bundles underlies plug-ins. However it is safe to regard
 * plug-ins and bundles as synonyms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Clients must never explicitly instantiate a plug-in runtime class</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical implementation pattern for plug-in runtime classes is to provide a
 * static convenience method to gain access to a plug-in's runtime object. This
 * way, code in other parts of the plug-in implementation without direct access
 * to the plug-in runtime object can easily obtain a reference to it, and thence
 * to any plug-in-wide resources recorded on it. An example for Eclipse 3.0
 * follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * package myplugin;
 *
 * public class MyPluginClass extends Plugin {
 * 	private static MyPluginClass instance;
 *
 * 	public static MyPluginClass getInstance() {
 * 		return instance;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	public void MyPluginClass() {
 * 		super();
 * 		instance = this;
 * 		// ... other initialization
 * 	}
 * 	// ... other methods
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, a call to <code>MyPluginClass.getInstance()</code> will
 * always return an initialized instance of <code>MyPluginClass</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Constructors and life cycle methods</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the plugin.xml of a plug-in indicates &lt;?eclipse version="3.0"?&gt; and
 * its prerequisite list includes <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>, the
 * default constructor of the plug-in class is used and
 * {@link #start(BundleContext)} and {@link #stop(BundleContext)} are called as
 * life cycle methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since Eclipse 3.0 APIs of the Plugin class can be called only when the Plugin
 * is in an active state, i.e., after it was started up and before it is
 * shutdown. In particular, it means that Plugin APIs should not be called from
 * overrides of {@link #Plugin()}.
 * </p>
