/**
 * Stores all the relationships between locks (rules are also considered locks),
 * and the threads that own them. All the relationships are stored in a 2D integer array.
 * The rows in the array are threads, while the columns are locks.
 * Two corresponding arrayLists store the actual threads and locks.
 * The index of a thread in the first arrayList is the index of the row in the graph.
 * The index of a lock in the second arrayList is the index of the column in the graph.
 * An entry greater than 0 in the graph is the number of times a thread in the entry's row
 * acquired the lock in the entry's column.
 * An entry of -1 means that the thread is waiting to acquire the lock.
 * An entry of 0 means that the thread and the lock have no relationship.
 *
 * The difference between rules and locks is that locks can be suspended, while
 * rules are implicit locks and as such cannot be suspended.
 * To resolve deadlock, the graph will first try to find a thread that only owns
 * locks. Failing that, it will find a thread in the deadlock that owns at least
 * one lock and suspend it.
 *
 * Deadlock can only occur among locks, or among locks in combination with rules.
 * Deadlock among rules only is impossible. Therefore, in any deadlock one can always
 * find a thread that owns at least one lock that can be suspended.
 *
 * The implementation of the graph assumes that a thread can only own 1 rule at
 * any one time. It can acquire that rule several times, but a thread cannot
 * acquire 2 non-conflicting rules at the same time.
 *
 * The implementation of the graph will sometimes also find and resolve bogus deadlocks.
 * 		graph:				assuming this rule hierarchy:
 * 		   R2 R3 L1						R1
 * 		J1  1  0  0					   /  \
 * 		J2  0  1 -1					  R2  R3
 * 		J3 -1  0  1
 *
 * If in the above situation job4 decides to acquire rule1, then the graph will transform
 * to the following:
 * 		   R2 R3 R1 L1
 * 		J1  1  0  1  0
 * 		J2  1  1  1 -1
 * 		J3 -1  0  0  1
 * 		J4  0  0 -1  0
 *
 * and the graph will assume that job2 and job3 are deadlocked and suspend lock1 of job3.
 * The reason the deadlock is bogus is that the deadlock is unlikely to actually happen (the threads
 * are currently not deadlocked, but might deadlock later on when it is too late to detect it)
 * Therefore, in order to make sure that no deadlock is possible,
 * the deadlock will still be resolved at this point.
