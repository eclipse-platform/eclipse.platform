/**
 * A project is a type of resource which groups resources
 * into buildable, reusable units.
 * <p>
 * Features of projects include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A project collects together a set of files and folders.</li>
 * <li>A project's location controls where the project's resources are
 *		stored in the local file system.</li>
 * <li>A project's build spec controls how building is done on the project.</li>
 * <li>A project can carry session and persistent properties.</li>
 * <li>A project can be open or closed; a closed project is
 * 		passive and has a minimal in-memory footprint.</li>
 * <li>A project can have one or more project build configurations.</li>
 * <li>A project can carry references to other project build configurations.</li>
 * <li>A project can have one or more project natures.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Projects implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface;
 * extensions are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see Platform#getAdapterManager()
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.

	 * will be de-configured. If this flag is specified, natures can still be added or
	 * removed, but they will not be configured or de-configured.
