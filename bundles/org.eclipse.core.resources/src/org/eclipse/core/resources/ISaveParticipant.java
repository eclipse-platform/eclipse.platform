	 * The basic contract for this method is the same for full saves,
	 * snapshots and project saves: the participant must absolutely guarantee that any
	 * important user data it has gathered will not be irrecoverably lost
	 * in the event of a crash. The only difference is in the space-time
	 * tradeoffs that the participant should make.</p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Full saves: the participant is
	 * encouraged to save additional non-essential information that will aid
	 * it in retaining user state and configuration information and quickly getting
	 * back in sync with the state of the platform at a later point.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>Snapshots: the participant is discouraged from saving non-essential
	 * information that could be recomputed in the unlikely event of a crash.
	 * This lifecycle event will happen often and participant actions should take
	 * an absolute minimum of time.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>Project saves: the participant should only save project related data.
	 * It is discouraged from saving non-essential information that could be recomputed
	 * in the unlikely event of a crash.
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * For instance, the Java IDE gathers various user preferences and would want to
	 * make sure that the current settings are safe and sound after a
	 * <code>save</code> (if not saved immediately).
	 * The Java IDE would likely save computed image builder state on full saves,
	 * because this would allow the Java IDE to be restarted later and not
	 * have to recompile the world at that time. On the other hand, the Java
	 * IDE would not save the image builder state on a snapshot because
	 * that information is non-essential; in the unlikely event of a crash,
	 * the image should be rebuilt either from scratch or from the last saved
	 * state.
	 * <p>
	 * The following snippet shows how a plug-in participant would write
	 * its important state to a file whose name is based on the save
	 * number for this save operation.</p>
	 * <pre>
	 *     Plugin plugin = ...; // known
	 *     int saveNumber = context.getSaveNumber();
	 *     String saveFileName = "save-" + Integer.toString(saveNumber);
	 *     File f = plugin.getStateLocation().append(saveFileName).toFile();
	 *     plugin.writeImportantState(f);
	 *     context.map(new Path("save"), new Path(saveFileName));
	 *     context.needSaveNumber();
	 *     context.needDelta(); // optional
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * When the plug-in is reactivated in a subsequent workspace session,
	 * it needs to re-register to participate in workspace saves. When it
	 * does so, it is handed back key information about what state it had last
	 * saved. If it's interested, it can also ask for a resource delta
	 * describing all resource changes that have happened since then, if this
	 * information is still available.
	 * The following snippet shows what a participant plug-in would
	 * need to do if and when it is reactivated:
	 * </p>
	 * <pre>
	 *     IWorkspace ws = ...; // known
	 *     Plugin plugin = ...; // known
	 *     ISaveParticipant saver = ...; // known
