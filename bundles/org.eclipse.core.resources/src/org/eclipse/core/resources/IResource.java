/**
 * The workspace analog of file system files
 * and directories.  There are exactly four <i>types</i> of resource:
 * files, folders, projects and the workspace root.
 * <p>
 * File resources are similar to files in that they
 * hold data directly.  Folder resources are analogous to directories in that they
 * hold other resources but cannot directly hold data.  Project resources
 * group files and folders into reusable clusters.  The workspace root is the
 * top level resource under which all others reside.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Features of resources:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>IResource</code> objects are <i>handles</i> to state maintained
 *		by a workspace.  That is, resource objects do not actually contain data
 *		themselves but rather represent resource state and give it behavior.  Programmers
 *		are free to manipulate handles for resources that do not exist in a workspace
 *		but must keep in mind that some methods and operations require that an actual
 *		resource be available.</li>
 * <li>Resources have two different kinds of properties as detailed below.  All
 *		properties are keyed by qualified names.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Session properties: Session properties live for the lifetime of one execution of
 *		the workspace.  They are not stored on disk.  They can carry arbitrary
 *		object values.  Clients should be aware that these values are kept in memory
 *		at all times and, as such, the values should not be large.</li>
 * <li>Persistent properties: Persistent properties have string values which are stored
 *		on disk across platform sessions.  The value of a persistent property is a
 * 		string which should be short (i.e., under 2KB). </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Resources are identified by type and by their <i>path</i>, which is similar to a file system
 * 		path.  The name of a resource is the last segment of its path. A resource's parent
 *		is located by removing the last segment (the resource's name) from the resource's full path.</li>
 * <li>Resources can be local or non-local. A non-local resource is one whose
 * 		contents and properties have not been fetched from a repository.</li>
 * <li><i>Phantom</i> resources represent incoming additions or outgoing deletions
 *		which have yet to be reconciled with a synchronization partner. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Resources implement the {@link IAdaptable} interface;
 * extensions are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see IWorkspace
 * @see Platform#getAdapterManager()
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
