/**
 * A resource rule factory returns scheduling rules for API methods
 * that modify the workspace. These rules can be used when creating jobs
 * or other operations that perform a series of modifications on the workspace.
 * This allows clients to implement two phase commit semantics, where all
 * necessary rules are obtained prior to executing a long running operation.
 * <p>
 * Note that simple use of the workspace APIs does not require use of scheduling
 * rules.  All workspace API methods that modify the workspace will automatically
 * obtain any scheduling rules needed to perform the modification.  However, if you
 * are aggregating a set of changes to the workspace using <code>WorkspaceJob</code>
 * or <code>ICoreRunnable</code> you can use scheduling rules to lock a
 * portion of the workspace for the duration of the job or runnable.  If you
 * provide a non-null scheduling rule, a runtime exception will occur if you try to
 * modify a portion of the workspace that is not covered by the rule for the runnable or job.
 * <p>
 * If more than one rule is needed, they can be aggregated using the
 * <code>MultiRule.combine</code> method.  Simplifying a group of rules does not change
 * the set of resources that are covered, but can improve job scheduling performance.
 * <p>
 * Note that <code>null</code> is a valid scheduling rule (indicating that no
 * resources need to be locked), and thus all methods in this class may
 * return <code>null</code>.
 *
 * @see WorkspaceJob
 * @see IWorkspace#run(ICoreRunnable, ISchedulingRule, int, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)
