	 * take care of discarding the builder's last built state (there is no need to

	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided by the
	 * given progress monitor. All builders should report their progress and honor
	 * cancel requests in a timely manner. Cancelation requests should be propagated
	 * to the caller by throwing <code>OperationCanceledException</code>.
