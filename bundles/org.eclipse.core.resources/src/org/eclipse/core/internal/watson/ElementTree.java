/**
 * An ElementTree can be viewed as a generic rooted tree that stores
 * a hierarchy of elements.  An element in the tree consists of a
 * (name, data, children) 3-tuple.  The name can be any String, and
 * the data can be any Object.  The children are a collection of zero
 * or more elements that logically fall below their parent in the tree.
 * The implementation makes no guarantees about the ordering of children.
 *
 * Elements in the tree are referenced by a key that consists of the names
 * of all elements on the path from the root to that element in the tree.
 * For example, if root node "a" has child "b", which has child "c", element
 * "c" can be referenced in the tree using the key (/a/b/c).  Keys are represented
 * using IPath objects, where the Paths are relative to the root element of the
 * tree.
 * @see IPath
 *
 * Each ElementTree has a single root element that is created implicitly and
 * is always present in any tree.  This root corresponds to the key (/),
 * or the singleton <code>Path.ROOT</code>.  The root element cannot be created
 * or deleted, and its data and name cannot be set.  The root element's children
 * however can be modified (added, deleted, etc).  The root path can be obtained
 * using the <code>getRoot()</code> method.
 *
 * ElementTrees are modified in generations.  The method <code>newEmptyDelta()</code>
 * returns a new tree generation that can be modified arbitrarily by the user.
 * For the purpose of explanation, we call such a tree "active".
 * When the method <code>immutable()</code> is called, that tree generation is
 * frozen, and can never again be modified.  A tree must be immutable before
 * a new tree generation can start.  Since all ancestor trees are immutable,
 * different active trees can have ancestors in common without fear of
 * thread corruption problems.
 *
 * Internally, any single tree generation is simply stored as the
 * set of changes between itself and its most recent ancestor (its parent).
 * This compact delta representation allows chains of element trees to
 * be created at relatively low cost.  Clients of the ElementTree can
 * instantaneously "undo" sets of changes by navigating up to the parent
 * tree using the <code>getParent()</code> method.
 *
 * Although the delta representation is compact, extremely long delta
 * chains make for a large structure that is potentially slow to query.
 * For this reason, the client is encouraged to minimize delta chain
 * lengths using the <code>collapsing(int)</code> and <code>makeComplete()</code>
 * methods.  The <code>getDeltaDepth()</code> method can be used to
 * discover the length of the delta chain.  The entire delta chain can
 * also be re-oriented in terms of the current element tree using the
 * <code>reroot()</code> operation.
 *
 * Classes are also available for tree serialization and navigation.
 * @see ElementTreeReader
 * @see ElementTreeWriter
 * @see ElementTreeIterator
 *
 * Finally, why are ElementTrees in a package called "watson"?
 * 	- "It's ElementTree my dear Watson, ElementTree."
