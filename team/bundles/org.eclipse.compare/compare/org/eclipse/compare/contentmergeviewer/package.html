Support for compare and merge viewers which show the
content side-by-side.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>

The <b>ContentMergeViewer</b> is an abstract compare and merge viewer
with two side-by-side content areas and an optional content area for a
common ancestor (for three-way compare). Because the implementation makes
no assumptions about the content type it is a subclass responsibility to
deal with a specific type. Its subclass <b>ImageMergeViewer</b> in
package org.eclipse.compare.internal shows how to base a simple
mergeviewer for images on <b>ContentMergeViewer</b>.
<p>

A <b>ContentMergeViewer</b> accesses its model by means of a content
provider which must implement the <b>IMergeViewerContentProvider</b> interface.
<p>

The <b>TextMergeViewer</b> is the standard concrete subclass of
<b>ContentMergeViewer</b> for comparing and merging text content.
<br>
A text merge viewer uses the <b>org.eclipse.compare.rangedifferencer.RangeDifferencer</b>
to perform a textual, line-by-line comparison of two (or three) input documents.
For text lines that differ the <b>TextMergeViewer</b> uses an <b>ITokenComparator</b>
to find longest sequences of matching and non-matching tokens.
The <b>TextMergeViewer</b>'s
default token compare works on characters separated by whitespace. If a
different strategy is needed (for example, Java tokens in a Java-aware
merge viewer), clients can create their own token comparators by implementing
the <b>ITokenComparator</b> interface.
<p>The <b>TextMergeViewer</b> not only works on whole documents but on
subranges of documents too. In this case the viewer's input must be an
<b>IDocumentRange</b> instead of an <b>IDocument</b>.
