Application programming interfaces for defining and working with repository providers.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package specifies the API for defining repository providers. A repository
provider supports the sharing of projects in the local Eclipse workspace
with remote locations managed by a particular type of repository system. 
Additional facilities included in this API exist for the mapping and unmapping of a 
repository provider to a project, the definition of a project set serializer for
sharing workspace setup, and the management of global ignore patterns and content type
determination for files.
