FAQ What is the difference between a toolbar and a cool bar?
============================================================

A cool bar is a special kind of toolbar that allows the user to reposition its items dynamically. Cool bars will also add more rows as necessary when items are added or moved. You can lock cool bars programmatically by calling CoolBar.setLocked, preventing the user from making further layout changes. The only limitation of cool bars is that, unlike ordinary toolbars, they can be oriented only horizontally. Otherwise, they are created and used just like standard toolbars. In Eclipse 3.0, JFace introduced a CoolBarManager class for helping to manage contributions to a cool bar, just as ToolBarManager is used for regular toolbars.
