FAQ How can I search the existing list of bugs in Eclipse?
==========================================================

Visit the Eclipse bugs Web site to search for an existing bug report. 
The Eclipse Project uses [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org) for bug reporting and uses it to not only store bug reports but also feature requests, plan items, and architectural discussions. Before posting a bug, see whether it has been posted already. If you find yourself overwhelmed by the Bugzilla query page, you're not alone. Look for the link at the bottom of the query page, **Give me a clue about how to use this form**.
