FAQ How do I support source-level debugging for my own language?
================================================================

Writing an integrated source debugger for a language is a highly specialized topic requiring major study and a lot of work, and many subtleties are involved. To do the topic justice, we can only refer you to the platform documentation and to JDT debugging as a reference implementation. Start by looking in the _Platform Plug-in Developer Guide_ under **Programmer's Guide > Program debug and launch support**.
