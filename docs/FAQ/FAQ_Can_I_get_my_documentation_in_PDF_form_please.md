FAQ Can I get my documentation in PDF form, please?
===================================================

PDF documentation is only available for Eclipse [3.1](https://www.eclipse.org/documentation/), but is no longer available for new releases.

When you download Eclipse code, documentation is provided in the form of HTML files, made accessible through a table of contents contained in a file called toc.xml. The contents of the HTML files can be browsed and searched easily with the Eclipse help system (see **Help > Help Contents**). The same information can be found online at the Eclipse documentation Web site.

Converting HTML to PDF form is somewhat labor-intensive. Although tools are available, such as HTMLDOC, to automatically convert HTML to PDF, the exact selection of files to include in the PDF and in what order requires some extra work. The best approach is to start with the toc.xml file and either write a conversion script or develop an Eclipse plug-in, as is done in the tocviewer plug-in used to write this book.
