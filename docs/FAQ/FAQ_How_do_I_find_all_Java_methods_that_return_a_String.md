FAQ How do I find all Java methods that return a String?
========================================================

The JDT contributes to the search framework by adding a **Java Search** tab to the Search dialog activated with the **Search** menu or by pressing Ctrl+H. Methods can be searched for by name and return type. The first word you enter in the Search dialog is interpreted as the method name, and the second word is interpreted as the method's return type. By specifying **\* String** and checking **Method** and **Declarations**, you will find all methods with a String return value (Figure 3.4).
