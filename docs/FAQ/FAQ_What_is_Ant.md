FAQ What is Ant?
================

Ant is a Java-based build tool created as part of the Apache open-source project. You can think of it as a Java version of _make_. Ant scripts have a structure and are written in XML. Similar to _make_, Ant targets can depend on other targets. For example, Ant is used in the context of plug-in development in the build.xml, created from a plugin.xml file for assembling a deployable version of your plug-in.

The Ant UI as provided in Eclipse comes with a first-class Ant build-file editor, including syntax highlighting, Content Assist, templates, and content formatting. This editor is automatically associated with files named build.xml and can be associated with other file names from the **Workbench > File Associations** preference page.

The Ant UI also has a wizard for running Ant scripts and a toolbar button for repeating previous builds.

For more details, such as how to run Ant scripts programmatically, refer to _Platform Plug-in Developer Guide_ under **Programmer's Guide > Platform Ant Support**.
