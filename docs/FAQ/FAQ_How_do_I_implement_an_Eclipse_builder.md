Eclipse./FAQ/How.md do I implement an Eclipse builder?
==================================================

To understand how Eclipse builds projects, you need to

*   Understand where Eclipse stores its project build specifications (See [FAQ Where are project build specifications stored?](./FAQ_Where_are_project_build_specifications_stored.md "FAQ Where are project build specifications stored?"))

*   Be able to add a builder to a given project (See [FAQ How do I add a builder to a given project?](./FAQ_How_do_I_add_a_builder_to_a_given_project.md "FAQ How do I add a builder to a given project?"))

*   Implement the builder (See [FAQ How do I implement an incremental project builder?](./FAQ_How_do_I_implement_an_incremental_project_builder.md "FAQ How do I implement an incremental project builder?"))

*   Make your compiler incremental (See[FAQ How do I make my compiler incremental?](./FAQ_How_do_I_make_my_compiler_incremental.md "FAQ How do I make my compiler incremental?"))

  
If you follow these instructions, but your builder does not seem to be called, consult [FAQ How do I handle setup problems for a given builder?](./FAQ_How_do_I_handle_setup_problems_for_a_given_builder.md "FAQ How do I handle setup problems for a given builder?")
