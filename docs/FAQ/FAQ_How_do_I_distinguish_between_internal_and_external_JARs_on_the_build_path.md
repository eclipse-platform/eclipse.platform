FAQ How do I distinguish between internal and external JARs on the build path?
==============================================================================

The Java build path differentiates between internal JARs and external JARs. To find the file-system location for an internal JAR, the workspace path needs to be converted into a file-system location, as follows:

      IClasspathEntry entry = ...
      IPath path = entry.getPath();
      IWorkspace workspace = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace();
      IResource jarFile= workspace.getRoot().findMember(path);
      if (jarFileÂ != null) {
         return jarFile.getLocation();
      } else {
         // must be an external JAR (or invalid classpath entry)
      }
