FAQ What open source projects are based on Eclipse?
===================================================

Thousands of projects of various sizes are based on Eclipse. A small number are directly supported by the Eclipse Foundation as official Eclipse projects but a far greater number can be found elsewhere on the Web. Many are hosted at such sites as Source Forge or GitHub or can be found floating around the Web.
