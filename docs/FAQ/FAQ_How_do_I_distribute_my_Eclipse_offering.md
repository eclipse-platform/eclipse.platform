FAQ How do I distribute my Eclipse offering?
============================================

That depends. If you just got started and are still testing your plug-ins or if you have few internal customers, you may be happy with simply building a plug-in and providing your users with a Zip file. Once you get more professional and have access to a Web site where people can access your plug-ins, an update site is recommended. To be in full control of how and where your offering is installed, you could use a more traditional form of product installation through a custom installer program.
