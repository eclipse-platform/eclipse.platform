FAQ How do I create a label decorator declaratively?
====================================================

The workbench provides the org.eclipse.ui.decorators extension point, for contributing label decorators. These decorators can either be entirely declarative, or they can contribute an implementation of the interface called ILightweightLabelDecorator to perform the decoration. The mechanics of implementing decorators are well described in the online Eclipse articles and in the platform documentation.
