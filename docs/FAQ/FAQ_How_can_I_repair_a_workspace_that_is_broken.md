FAQ How can I repair a workspace that is broken?
================================================

In some rare situations, the Eclipse workspace can become corrupt and unreadable. In particular, this can happen when VM errors, such as OutOfMemoryError, occur. The platform core team home page includes a plug-in that can be used to restore a workspace that has become corrupt. This plug-in will be able to restore only basic workspace metadata information, so metadata created by other plug-ins may still be lost. From eclipse.org, select **Projects** \> Eclipse Project > Platform > Core**, and then look for the workspace** restorer plug-in on the development resources page. Be sure to also enter a bug report in the Eclipse Bugzilla with any available log information to help prevent such disasters from happening to others!
