FAQ How do I open a type in a Java editor?
==========================================

Opening a given type in an editor can be done in many ways.

  

*   If you see the type in your editor, move the caret inside the name, or select the type and press F3. This works inside javadoc comments.

  

*   Hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse around inside a Java editor. You will notice types turning into hyperlinks: blue underlined names, just like in a Web browser.

  

*   To open a dialog with a list of available types, press Ctrl+Shift+T.

  

*   To open its type hierarchy, select a type in a Java editor, and press F4.

  

*   To open a type hierarchy on any type, press Ctrl+Shift+H.

  

*   To quickly navigate to a given type in the Package Explorer, give focus to the tree, and start typing the name of the type. The Explorer will automatically scroll to the type, assuming that the type is visible and has not been filtered out of the view. This works in Windows only.

  
Note that when opening a type hierarchy, there is a preference on the **Java** preference page to open the type in a new type hierarchy perspective versus simply opening a view. This is useful in conjunction with the preference to open perspectives in a new window on the **Workbench > Perspectives** preference page. This allows you to browse a hierarchy without cluttering and losing context in the editors and views in your main window.
