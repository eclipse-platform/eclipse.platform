FAQ How do I show/hide files like classpath in the Navigator?
=============================================================

Use the menu for Navigator: the small triangle in the Navigator title bar. Select **Filters...** and check the type of files you want to hide. This technique also applies to the JDT's Package Explorer.

  

If your plug-in must store metadata in the project content area, consider adding a filter to this list, using the org.eclipse.ui.ide.resourceFilters extension point. The filter specifies a file name pattern and a Boolean attribute specifying whether the filter should be on by default. As an example, the Java development tools add a filter using this mechanism to hide Java class files generated by the compiler.
