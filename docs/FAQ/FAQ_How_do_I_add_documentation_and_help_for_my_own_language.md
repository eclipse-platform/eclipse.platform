FAQ How do I add documentation and help for my own language?
============================================================

Documentation for plug-ins, including those that implement a programming language is done by contributing to the extension point. Open the plug-in Manifest Editor on your plug-in and switch to the Extensions page. Click on **Add...** and choose **Extension Templates > Help Contents** (see Figure 19.8).

  
Click **Next** and provide details. Click **OK**. Voila, your plug-in now has documentation exported in the standard Eclipse Help format, provided through **Help > Help Contents...**.
