FAQ How do I report a bug?
==========================

Successful open source projects thrive because of the support of their community. The easiest way to contribute back to the community is to report bugs. If you encounter problems with Eclipse, or want to suggest a way to enhance it, make your way over to [https://bugs.eclipse.org](https://bugs.eclipse.org). You will need to [create an account](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/createaccount.cgi) before entering a report, but anyone can browse the existing bug database without registering. The [https://bugs.eclipse.org](https://bugs.eclipse.org) page has loads of useful information on how to enter a good bug report. Follow the advice carefully, because the quality and clarity of a bug report makes a huge difference in how quickly developers can track down and solve the problem.

If your bug involves a hang, freeze, or even a long pause without responsiveness, see [How to report a deadlock](/How_to_report_a_deadlock "How to report a deadlock") for more details on what kind of information to provide.
