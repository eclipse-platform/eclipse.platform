FAQ Where can I find information about writing builders?
========================================================

Incremental project builders are used to transform resources in a project to produce some output. As the project changes, the builder is responsible for incrementally updating its output based on the nature of the changes. Some excellent resources are available on how builders work and how to create your own, so we won't get into more detail here.
