FAQ What Eclipse mailing lists are available?
=============================================

Although Eclipse newsgroups are intended for users and extenders of the platform, the mailing lists are specifically targeted at those who are actively contributing to the development of Eclipse itself. Messages focus mainly on new areas of development, administrative messages about release dates and build information, and general discussions of the subtopic controlled by the mailing list.

|   **Warning:** Unless you are actively contributing to an Eclipse project, have a vested interest in the topic, or have special expertise to contribute, you should simply _read_ the archive for the mailing list and _ask questions_ on the corresponding newsgroups.   |
