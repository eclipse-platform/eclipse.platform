FAQ What academic research projects are based on Eclipse?
=========================================================

Much of the academic research on Eclipse is propelled by the Eclipse Innovation Grants, a financial stimulation project funded by IBM in 2003 and renewed for 2004. The award winners are prominently profiled at the  [Eclipse community Web site](https://eclipse.org/community).

The Eclipse-oriented research projects have topics that vary widely, such as educational software, modeling tools, program analysis, reverse engineering, aspect-oriented programming, alternative language support, Design Patterns, automated testing, software lifecycle support, groupware techniques, debugging, optimization, and software requirement analysis and specification.

Essentially, all these projects benefit from the strengths of Eclipse: an open source platform that is easily extensible, and very well documented. Using Eclipse gives these research projects a running start and allows them to focus on pushing the envelope in the specific vertical domains they are targeting.
