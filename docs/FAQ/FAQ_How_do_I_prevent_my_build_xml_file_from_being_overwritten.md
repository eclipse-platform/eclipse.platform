FAQ How do I prevent my build.xml file from being overwritten?
==============================================================

Normally, you can use the build.xml file that is automatically generated for you, based on your plug-in manifest and the contents of your build.properties file. However, in some situations, you might want to customize your own plug-in build script. To prevent PDE from deleting your custom build script, open build.properties for your plug-in and check **This plug-in uses a custom build script**.
