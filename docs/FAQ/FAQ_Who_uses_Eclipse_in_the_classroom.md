FAQ Who uses Eclipse in the classroom?
======================================

A growing number of universities worldwide are deploying Eclipse as a vehicle for computer science classes. The platform itself can be used very well as an example of state-of-the-art software. Analysis of the Design Patterns adopted in Eclipse could alone easily fill a curriculum for a year. In addition, Eclipse can be used by students to write their own plug-ins. With minimal effort, interesting topics can be explored and impressive results obtained.

Various sources of classroom materials are circulating. International universities that are known to teach courses about Eclipse include, but are not limited to, Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Ecole des Mines de Nantes in France, University of Tuebingen in Germany, Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, and University of British Columbia in Vancouver.

Owing to the success of using Eclipse in the classroom, the Eclipse Ececis Project was formed in late 2003. Its goals are collaboration and participation in the development and use of open _free_ courseware for Eclipse and related technologies.
