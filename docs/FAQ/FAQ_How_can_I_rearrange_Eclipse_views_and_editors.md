FAQ How can I rearrange Eclipse views and editors?
==================================================

Eclipse allows you a great deal of flexibility in how the views and editors are presented in the workbench. With the mouse, views can be docked as fast views in toolbars, grouped together in stacks, and dragged around to different areas. Any view can also be maximized by double-clicking its title bar or pressing Ctrl+M, or it can be minimized to show only its title bar.

With editors, you can likewise resize or organize in a number of ways. All editors must be grouped together in one area, but they can be split horizontally or vertically within that area to show multiple editors simultaneously. Editors can also be maximized, by double-clicking the title bar or pressing Ctrl+M, or minimized to show only its title bar.

Many of these actions can be mapped to a key binding from the **Workbench >** Keys **preference page. Look at the commands in the** Window **category** to see what commands can be bound to your own key sequences. Most part-manipulation commands are also found in the part context menu, accessible by pressing Alt+- (Alt+minus).

The [Eclipse Help system](https://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp), under Workbench User Guide / Getting Started, includes a tutorial that explains the basics of using the workbench. A free video tutorial [Using the Eclipse Workbench](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/workbench.html) is also available.
