FAQ How do I control the Java formatter?
========================================

By activating **Window > Preferences > Java > Code Formatter**, you can create a new formatting profile. The choices for the various layout characteristics show the depth and breadth of the JDT code formatter. Full control exists over indentation, placement of braces, whitespace, blank lines, control statements, line wrapping, and comments. With the code formatter preference settings, a profile can easily be customized, saved, and shared with a team of developers to maintain a consistent company style.
