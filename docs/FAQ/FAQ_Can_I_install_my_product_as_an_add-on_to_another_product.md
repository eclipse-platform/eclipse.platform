FAQ Can I install my product as an add-on to another product?
=============================================================

Yes. A product that adds functionality to another installed product is called a _product extension_. A product extension is installed in a location separate from the main product, making it cleaner to install, uninstall, and upgrade both the product and any product extensions. The exact format of a product extension is well described in the Platform Plug-in Developer Guide, under **Programmer's Guide >** Packaging and delivering Eclipse based products > Product extensions**.**
