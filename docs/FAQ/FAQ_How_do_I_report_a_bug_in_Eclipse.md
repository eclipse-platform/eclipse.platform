FAQ How do I report a bug in Eclipse?
=====================================

See https://github.com/eclipse-platform/#reporting-issues for reporting issues.

As Eclipse is an open source project driven by only a few people, you could also consider contributing a code change to fix this bug or to implement your missing feature. See https://github.com/eclipse-platform/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md for how to contribute.
