FAQ How do I find out what plug-ins have been installed?
========================================================

One way of finding out is to select **Help > About Eclipse Platform >**. From this dialog, click **Plug-in Details** to get a list of all installed plug-ins, along with vendor and version information. If you instead click **Configuration Details**, you will be rewarded with a full credit report of your current Eclipse installation. The main sections contain information about your system properties, what features and plug-ins have been installed, preferences specified by you, the Update Manager log, and a dump of the error log, which lists problems that have been reported by various plug-ins.
