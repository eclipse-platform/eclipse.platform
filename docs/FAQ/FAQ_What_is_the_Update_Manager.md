FAQ What is the Update Manager?
===============================

The Update Manager allows you to find new plug-ins on your machine, your network, or the Internet, compare new plug-ins to your configuration, and install only those that are compatible with your current configuration. The Update Manager thinks in terms of _features_, a logical group of related plug-ins, and also provides support for managing configurations to undo a given installation or to automatically update all the features currently installed in your Eclipse configuration.

Before plug-ins can be installed by the Update Manager, they need to be collected into a feature. The feature itself has to be published using an update site.

The Update Manager is invoked by **Help > Software Updates**.

Remember to have an 'open' connection to the internet when updating. Proxy settings can prevent the update mechanism from reaching the locations you want/need. The proxy-settings can be changed using **Windows > Preferences > General > Network Connections**.
