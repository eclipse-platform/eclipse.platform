FAQ Do I use plugin or plug-in?
===============================

That depends. Those with a slavish devotion to the dictates of the English language-copy editors, English teachers, and automatic spellcheckers-will insist that because plugin is not a recognized word, the hyphenated plug-in is required. Others-writers, hackers, and the general public-recognize that language is an organic structure that must adapt and evolve to remain relevant. This latter group welcomes the introduction of new words into the lexicon and, thus, will happily adopt the new word _plugin_. While we use _plug-in_ in this book, here is a more practical answer: If you are searching in the documentation, use plug-in. If you are grepping or writing code, use plugin. If you do not think _grepping_ is a word, you are a lost cause.
