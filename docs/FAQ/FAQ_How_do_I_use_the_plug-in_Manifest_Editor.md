FAQ How do I use the plug-in Manifest Editor?
=============================================

The plug-in Manifest Editor (Figure 4.2) is used to edit the XML description contained in the plugin.xml file. The editor is activated by double-clicking the plugin.xml file in the Navigator.


The editor consists of six different editor panes. The **Overview** pane gives a summary of the plug-in's configuration and links to the other editor panes. For instance, clicking on **More...** in the **Extensions** section takes you to the **Extensions** editor pane. The first five editors provide visual access to the underlying XML text shown in the **Source** pane.
