FAQ How do I create a feature?
==============================

Select **File > New > Other... > Plug-in Development** \> Feature Project**, and choose the plug-ins you want to add.**

  

One important caveat is that in order for features to be installable using an update site, you have to specify a license agreement. Open the Feature Editor on your feature.xml file, select the **Information** tab, and enter the license text under the **License Agreement** section. For testing, a simple **CPL 1.0** will do.

  
Q: How do you know if your project is a "Feature Project"? A: (I'm guessing) It has a feature.xml
