FAQ How do I create a new perspective?
======================================

Use the org.eclipse.ui.perspectives extension point. This extension point allows you to define an initial layout of views relative to the editor area, in addition to specifying the contents of the window's menu and toolbars. Everything you can do from **Window > Customize Perspective** can be done programmatically with the perspectives extension point. The steps for creating your own perspective are well described in the _Platform Plug-in Developer's Guide_.
