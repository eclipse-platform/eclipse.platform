FAQ What is the difference between a perspective and a workbench page?
======================================================================

The workbench page is the main body of a workbench window: between the toolbar and the status line, the area that contains views and editors. In Eclipse 1.0, each workbench window could have multiple pages, but this has not been the case since Eclipse 2.0. The workbench page can have one or more perspectives associated with it that define the layout of the views and editors in the page. Each workbench page has at most one instance of each kind of view and one editor per unique editor input. When the perspective is changed, the position and visibility of views and editors change, but the set of open views and editors does not change.
