FAQ/Language integration/phase 2: How do I implement a DOM?
===========================================================

In phase 1 of our language integration, we focused on the compilation of source code and the build process of programs written in our new language. Our experience is that it is smart to follow this bottom-up approach. It may be tempting to start with the visual components, such as the editor, but developing an IDE is like building a home. Excavation and foundation pouring is a useful step and should not be skipped too hastily.

Therefore, before we can implement an editor, we need to follow phase 2. Even though phase 2 has only one step, it is a very important one and should be given plenty of attention. Namely, by carefully designing a Document Object Model (DOM) first, many of the following steps will be a lot easier to implement. After doing phase 1-implementing a compiler and a builder-and finishing phase 2-implementing a DOM-you are ready to move to [FAQ Language integration phase 3: How do I edit programs?](./FAQ_Language_integration_phase_3_How_do_I_edit_programs.md "FAQ Language integration phase 3: How do I edit programs?")
