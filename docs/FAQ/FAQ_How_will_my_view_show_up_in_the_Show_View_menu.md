FAQ How will my view show up in the Show View menu?
===================================================

All views show up automatically under **Show View > Other...**. The category attribute in your view extension declaration defines what folder your view appears under in this dialog. And no, you cannot prevent your view from appearing in this dialog.

  
The active perspective defines the set of views that appear in the **Show View** submenu. If you define your own perspective or a perspective extension to another plug-in's perspective, you get to contribute entries to this list. The user is always allowed to customize the perspective to change the set of views that appear here.
