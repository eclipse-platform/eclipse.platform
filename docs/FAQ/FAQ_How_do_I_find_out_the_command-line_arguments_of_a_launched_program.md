FAQ How do I find out the command-line arguments of a launched program?
=======================================================================

In the Debug view, use the context menu on the process in question, and select **Properties...**. From this dialog you can see the exact command line that was passed to the JVM. If you launched in debug mode, there will be some extra command line arguments that instruct the JVM to run in debug mode. To show the Debug view, you can use **Window > Show View > Debug > Debug**.
