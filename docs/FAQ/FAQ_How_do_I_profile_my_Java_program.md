FAQ How do I profile my Java program?
=====================================

Eclipse has built-in support for launching applications and for debugging Java applications but no inherent support for profiling. However, support for profilers can be implemented by using a special launch configuration. Commercial products, such as WebSphere Studio Application Developer, do this by adding profiling support to their set of plug-ins. Much of this work is being standardized and moved down into the open source Eclipse subproject called Hyades.

A couple of individual profiler projects and products are under way. The Eclipse Colorer profiler with elaborate reporting views may be of interest to people who want to experiment with profiling Java code from Eclipse. This profiler can be downloaded under the CPL from SourceForge.

See [FAQ When do I use a launch delegate?](./FAQ_When_do_I_use_a_launch_delegate.md "FAQ When do I use a launch delegate?") for a discussion of how profilers are implemented.
