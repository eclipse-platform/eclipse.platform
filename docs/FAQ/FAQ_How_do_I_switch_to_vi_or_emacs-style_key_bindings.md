FAQ How do I switch to vi or emacs-style key bindings?
======================================================

Eclipse has a built-in key-binding configuration that emulates emacs-style key bindings. You can switch to this mode by using the **Keys** preference page. There is no equivalent configuration setting to emulate vi, largely because of its mode-oriented approach. On the Web, however, there is a plug-in that emulates vi-style key bindings in Eclipse.
