Application programming interfaces for dependency injection object suppliers.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package provides application programming interfaces for suppliers of objects that
are searched by the dependency injection framework.
<p>
Injector takes the actual values to be injected from object suppliers. There are two types 
of object suppliers: primary and extended. A primary supplier has to be specified for each 
injection request. Extended suppliers apply to all injection requests.
