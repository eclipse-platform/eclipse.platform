<h2 align="center">Core Tools</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

  
<p>Core Tools is a set of views and perspectives useful for people writing Eclipse 
  plugins or just wanting to know what is going on under the covers. Roughly speaking 
  there are three kinds of tools:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><b>Runtime tools</b></dt>
  <dd>The runtime tools expose the internal behaviour of the Platform runtime 
    as well as certain aspects of plugins (activation ordering, classes loaded, 
    relation to other plugins, ...) and classes (load order, load nesting, ...). 
    Plugin developers can use this information to ensure that their plugins/classes 
    are being activated/loaded as expected, and that they are not taking more 
    time/space than is warranted.</dd>
  <dt><b>Resources tools</b></dt>
  <dd>The resources tools expose the behaviour/performance of installed builders 
    and listeners as well as the structure of the workspace, resources and resource 
    deltas.</dd>
  <dt><b>Metadata tools</b></dt>
  <dd>The metadata tools enable users to investigate the metadata files used in 
    Eclipse. Point these tools at a metadata location and browse...</dd>
</dl>

  
<h3>Installing and Running Core Tools</h3> 

<h4>Installing Core Tools</h4>
<p>org.eclipse.core.tools are not part of a build anymore. To install the plug-in, select it and 
   export it as plug-in. Choose Install into host. Repository.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Running Core Tools</h4>
<p>After installing the Core Tools, you must enable them. The tools are enabled 
  using Eclipse's debug options mechanism. To run Eclipse in &quot;debug&quot; 
  mode, use the -debug command line option. If nothing else is said, Eclipse will 
  look for the file &lt;eclipse install&gt;/.options. This is a Java properties 
  file detailing which debug options should be enabled etc. See the Eclipse runtime 
  documentation for more details. </p>
<p>The org.eclipse.core.tools plugin contains an example .options file which enables 
  all options (except class load trace filters). To run Eclipse with the Core 
  Tools, either copy this file to your &lt;eclipse install&gt; directory or identify 
  it on the command line after -debug. For example, </p>
<pre>    eclipse -debug file:d:/.options</pre>
<p>Note that not all tools require enablement. You need only enable the debug 
  options required by the tools you choose to use. See the tool descriptions for 
  details.</p>
<p>If you are using PDE's runtime workbench then you can enable tracing and set 
  the appropriate options for the target workspace. See PDE Guide -&gt; Running 
  a plug-in -&gt; Running with tracing found in the standard Eclipse documentation 
  set for more information.</p>
<p>Once you are running with the Core Tools installed, there are a number of new 
  perspectives and views. These are accessed by opening a new perspective or using 
  the Window-&gt;Show View functions in the workbench.</p>
<h3>Runtime Tools</h3> 

 
<p>The runtime tooling contributes a Runtime Spy and Plugin Dependency perspectives. 
  Note that in some cases the views can be combined or used in other contexts. 
  The individual views are accessed via the Workspace-&gt;Show View-&gt;Runtime 
  Tools menu.</p>
<h4>Runtime Spy Perspective</h4>
<p>The Runtime Spy perspective shows information about the plugin activation, 
  class loading, resource bundles etc. It is extremely useful when trying to track 
  down why plugins are being activated or classes loaded as well as getting a 
  handle on how much code is loaded. This tool contains four views: </p>
<dl> 
  <dt><b>Activated Plugins</b> </dt>
  <dd>This is the list of plugins which have been activated since the start of 
    this Eclipse session. Included is total code footprint, startup time, activation 
    order as well as the number of classes loaded for each plugin.<br>
    When plugins are activated a snapshot of the execution stack is taken. This 
    stack trace can be viewed by selecting plugin and clicking on the stack trace 
    'T' button on the title bar or in the context menu.<br>
    The classes loaded by the selected plugins is shown in the Loaded Classes 
    view when the &quot;Classes&quot; button ('C') on the menu bar or context 
    menu is used.<br>
    Note that this list is not automatically updated when a new plugin is activated 
    so users should use the refresh button on the view title bar or in the context 
    menu.</dd>
  <dt><b>Loaded Classes</b> </dt>
  <dd>This view is populated with classes loaded by plugins selected in the Activated 
    Plugins view. For each class data such as load order and memory footprint 
    are listed. If the appropriate filtering is enabled when the platform is started 
    (see below), stack snapshots taken at class loading time are available by 
    selecting a class and using the Stack Trace menu entry or title bar button.</dd>
  <dt><b>Plugin Datasheet</b> </dt>
  <dd>Shows a summary of the currently selected plugin.</dd>
  <dt><b>Stack Trace</b> </dt>
  <dd>Shows a snapshot of the execution stack at the time of some event (e.g., 
    plugin activation, class loading).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following debug options control what data is available in Runtime Spy perspective 
  views.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/monitor/classes=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to monitor which classes are loaded.</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/monitor/activation=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to monitor which plugins are activated.</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/monitor/resources=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to monitor which resource bundles (i.e., *.properties files 
    ) are loaded</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/trace/classLoading=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to snapshot the execution stack when a class is loaded</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/trace/filename=&lt;file location&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The file in which execution traces are written</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/trace/filters=&lt;properties file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The location of a Java properties file identifying the classes which should 
    be traced (if trace/classLoading is true). The File format is: <br>
    plugins=&lt;comma separated list of plugins whose classes to trace&gt;<br>
    packages=&lt;comma separated list of package prefixes of classes to trace&gt;<br>
    Note that there may be many 'plugins' and 'packages' lines in one file.</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.osgi/trace/activation=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to snapshot the execution stack when a plugin is activated.<br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h4>Plug-In Dependency Perspective</h4>
<p>This perspective includes 2 views: a plug-in list view listing all the plug-ins 
  available in the workspace and a plug-in dependency view. The plug-in ids in 
  the list view are given in alphabetical order (according to their plug-in id). 
  Select a plug-in in the list view and the dependency view is updated to show 
  all plug-ins that the selected plug-in requires as well as all plug-ins that 
  require this selected plug-in. This information is currently only presented 
  in a text format.</p>
<h3>Resources Tools</h3>
<p>The Resources tooling consists of a number of views described below. These 
  are accessed via the Workspace-&gt;Show View-&gt;Resources Tools menu and can 
  be used independently or together to as desired. </p>
<h4>Resource Spy view</h4>
This view shows detailed public/internal information about the resource currently 
selected in any Eclipse view (e.g. Resource Navigator, Package Explorer, etc). 
It shows details about: flags, markers, synchronization information, session/persistent 
properties, content type). 
<h4>Delta Spy View</h4>
The Delta Spy listens for any resource changes, echoing the resource delta for 
each change event listened. For each affected resource (and its child resources), 
it shows the following information: 
<ul>
  <li>the resource's full path;</li>
  <li>the kind of change (between brackets): addition (+), phantom addition (&gt;), 
    removal (-), phantom removal (&lt;), change (*), no change (~), and unknown 
    (?);</li>
  <li>the change flags (between curly braces): CONTENT, MOVED_FROM, MOVED_TO, 
    OPEN, TYPE, SYNC, MARKERS, REPLACED, DESCRIPTION;</li>
  <li>in the case it is a marker change, it will show (between brackets) for each 
    marker changed: 
    <ul>
      <li>the kind of marker change: addition (+), removal (-), change (*);</li>
      <li>the marker's id;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if it is a team private change, a "(team private)" tag.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Graphical Delta Spy View</h4>
<p>The Graphical Delta Spy is similar to the Delta Spy describe above, but it 
  shows the resource delta tree using a tree widget instead of indented text. 
  This view can only show the resource delta tree for the last resource change 
  event only. However, it is easier to visualize a resource delta tree due to 
  its graphical nature.</p>
<p>The Graphical Delta Spy view provides a pull-down menu that allows the user 
  to select which types of events to listen to (PRE_BUILD, POST_BUILD, POST_CHANGE) 
  and whether phantom resources should be taken into account..</p>
<h4>Builders/Listeners Spy</h4>
<p>The Builders/Listeners Spy view displays statistical information about the 
  behaviour and performance of installed builders and resource change listeners. 
  The information includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of builder/listener (listeners do not technically have names so 
    their toString() is used)</li>
  <li>the project related to the builder (blank for listeners)</li>
  <li>the number of events (builds or resource changed) processed by the builder/listener</li>
  <li>the amount of time spent processing these events</li>
  <li>the number of core exceptions encountered</li>
</ul>
<p>For more informatioin on listeners see the Eclipse article &quot;How You've 
  Changed! Responding to resource changes in the Eclipse workspace&quot; by John 
  Arthorne (OTI) August 23, 2002. Documentation on builders can be found in the 
  Platform Plug-in Developer Guide included with the Eclipse documentation.</p>
<p>The following debug options control what data is available in Builder/Listener 
  Spy view.</p>
<dl> 
  <dt>org.eclipse.core.resources/monitor/builders=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to monitor which builders.</dd>
  <dt>org.eclipse.core.resources/monitor/listeners=&lt;boolean&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whether or not to monitor which listeners.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Metadata Tools</h3>
<p>The metadata tooling contributes a Metadata perspective. The individual views 
  are not particularly useful on their own but are accessed via the Window-&gt;Show 
  View-&gt;Metadata Tools menu.</p>
<h4>The Metadata Perspective</h4>
This perspective contains three views which allows the user to select a directory, 
browse any metadata found in it and see contents and integrity status of supported 
files. 
<dl> 
  <dt><b>Metadata Spy</b></dt>
  <dd>This view allows the user to select a given metadata directory and uses 
    a tree view to show a directory hierarchy containing all known metadata files 
    as leaf nodes. If the user double-clicks one of these leaf nodes, the Dump 
    Contents view will be opened having this file as its current selected file. 
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Dump Contents</b></dt>
  <dd>This view presents to the user the contents of a selected metadata file 
    in a human-readable format. It provides an action for selecting a new file 
    to dump. The contents layout will depend on what kind of file is being dumped. 
    This view has a sub-view called &quot;Dump Summary&quot; that shows whether 
    the file read was ok or not. </dd>
  <dt><b>Dump Summary</b></dt>
  <dd>This view presents to the user the results of a file dumped using the Dump 
    Contents view. In the case of a error during the dumping process (because 
    the metadata file being dumped was corrupted), the reason will be shown here, 
    along with the number of bytes read. This view will only be updated if it 
    is open when a file is being dumped. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Note: the dumping functionality is also available as a headless Eclipse application: 
  <tt>org.eclipse.core.tools.dumptool</tt>. To run it, you need to pass the file 
  to be dumped using the <tt>dump.file</tt> system property. For instance:</p>
<pre>eclipse -application org.eclipse.core.tools.dumptool -vmargs -Ddump.file=d:\eclipse\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi\.state</pre>
