<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse console.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The Eclipse platform UI console plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces to
facilitate the creation and display of consoles in the <b>ConsoleView</b>. This package
contains a generic abstract console (<b>AbstractConsole</b>) that provides some basic 
functionality as well as two complete implementations of consoles that may be subclassed.
 <p> The class <b>TextConsole</b> supports regular expression matching and hyperlinks. 
 Clients must provide their own document partitioner.
 </p>
<p><b>IOConsole</b> extends <b>TextConsole</b> and provides support for creating consoles based upon
input and output streams via the use of <b>IOConsoleOutputStream</b> and 
<b>IOConsoleInputStream</b>. IOConsole is not an abstract class, it may be used as is or
subclassed.
 </p>
<p>A console manager (<b>IConsoleManager</b>) manages all active consoles, and 
  provides notification of consoles which are added and removed. Consoles are 
  displayed in a page book view. Each console implementation is reponsible for 
  creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which provides freedom of presentation 
  to the console implementation. A single console may be displayed simultaneously 
  in multiple console views, in different workbench windows.
