/**
 * A job that makes an atomic modification to the workspace.  Clients must
 * implement the abstract method <code>runInWorkspace</code> instead
 * of the usual <code>Job.run</code> method.
 * <p>
 * After running a method that modifies resources in the workspace,
 * registered listeners receive after-the-fact notification of
 * what just transpired, in the form of a resource change event.
 * This method allows clients to call a number of
 * methods that modify resources and only have resource
 * change event notifications reported at the end of the entire
 * batch. This mechanism is used to avoid unnecessary builds
 * and notifications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Platform may decide to perform notifications during the operation.
 * The reason for this is that it is possible for multiple threads
 * to be modifying the workspace concurrently. When one thread finishes modifying
 * the workspace, a notification is required to prevent responsiveness problems,
 * even if the other operation has not yet completed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A WorkspaceJob is the asynchronous equivalent of ICoreRunnable
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the workspace is not locked against other threads during the execution
 * of a workspace job. Other threads can be modifying the workspace concurrently
 * with a workspace job.  To obtain exclusive access to a portion of the workspace,
 * set the scheduling rule on the job to be a resource scheduling rule.  The
 * interface {@link IResourceRuleFactory} is used to create a  scheduling rule
 * for a particular workspace modification operation.
