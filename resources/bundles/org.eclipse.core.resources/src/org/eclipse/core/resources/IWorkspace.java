/**
 * Workspaces are the basis for Eclipse Platform resource management. There is
 * only one workspace per running platform. All resources exist in the context
 * of this workspace.
 * <p>
 * A workspace corresponds closely to discreet areas in the local file system.
 * Each project in a workspace maps onto a specific area of the file system. The
 * folders and files within a project map directly onto the corresponding
 * directories and files in the file system. One sub-directory, the workspace
 * metadata area, contains internal information about the workspace and its
 * resources. This metadata area should be accessed only by the Platform or via
 * Platform API calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Workspaces add value over using the file system directly in that they allow
 * for comprehensive change tracking (through <code>IResourceDelta</code> s),
 * various forms of resource metadata (e.g., markers and properties) as well as
 * support for managing application/tool state (e.g., saving and restoring).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The workspace as a whole is thread safe and allows one writer concurrent with
 * multiple readers. It also supports mechanisms for saving and snapshotting the
 * current resource state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The workspace is provided by the Resources plug-in and is automatically
 * created when that plug-in is activated. The default workspace data area
 * (i.e., where its resources are stored) overlap exactly with the platform's
 * data area. That is, by default, the workspace's projects are found directly
 * in the platform's data area. Individual project locations can be specified
 * explicitly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommended way of accessing the Workspace is fetching it as a service
 * what could be performed in several ways:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For example in a Bundle/Plugin Activator:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ServiceTracker&lt;IWorkspace, IWorkspace&gt; workspaceTracker = new ServiceTracker&gt;&lt;(bundleContext, IWorkspace.class,
 * 		null);
 * workspaceTracker.open();
 * IWorkspace workspace = workspaceTracker.getService();
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>Using declarative service with annotations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Reference
 * private IWorkspace workspace;
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>Helper classes like ServiceCaller:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ServiceCaller.callOnce(getClass(), IWorkspace.class, workspace -&gt; {
 * 	// do something with the workspace
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The workspace resource namespace is always case-sensitive and
 * case-preserving. Thus the workspace allows multiple sibling resources to
 * exist with names that differ only in case. The workspace also imposes no
 * restrictions on valid characters in resource names, the length of resource
 * names, or the size of resources on disk. In situations where one or more
 * resources are stored in a file system that is not case-sensitive, or that
 * imposes restrictions on resource names, any failure to store or retrieve
 * those resources will be propagated back to the caller of workspace API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Workspaces implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions are
 * managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.

	 * perform the snapshot when possible. Even as a hint, snapshots should only
	 * be called when necessary as they impact system performance. Although
	 * saving does not change the workspace per se, its execution is serialized
	 * like methods that write the workspace.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The workspace is comprised of several different kinds of data with
	 * varying degrees of importance. The most important data, the resources
	 * themselves and their persistent properties, are written to disk
	 * immediately; other data are kept in volatile memory and only written to
	 * disk periodically; and other data are maintained in memory and never
	 * written out. The following table summarizes what gets saved when:</p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>creating or deleting resource - immediately</li>
	 * <li>setting contents of file - immediately</li>
	 * <li>changes to project description - immediately</li>
	 * <li>session properties - never</li>
	 * <li>changes to persistent properties - immediately</li>
	 * <li>markers -<code>save</code></li>
	 * <li>synchronizer info -<code>save</code></li>
	 * <li>shape of the workspace resource tree -<code>save</code></li>
	 * <li>list of active plug-ins - never</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Resource-based plug-in also have data with varying degrees of importance.
	 * Each plug-in gets to decide the policy for protecting its data, either
	 * immediately, never, or at <code>save</code> time. For the latter, the
	 * plug-in coordinates its actions with the workspace (see
	 * <code>ISaveParticipant</code> for details).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the platform is shutdown (or crashes) after saving the workspace, any
	 * information written to disk by the last successful workspace
	 * <code>save</code> will be restored the next time the workspace is
	 * reopened for the next session. Naturally, information that is written to
	 * disk immediately will be as of the last time it was changed.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The workspace provides a general mechanism for keeping concerned parties
	 * apprised of any and all changes to resources in the workspace (
	 * <code>IResourceChangeListener</code>). It is even possible for a
	 * plug-in to find out about changes to resources that happen between
	 * workspace sessions (see <code>IWorkspace.addSaveParticipant</code>).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * At certain points during this method, the entire workspace resource tree
	 * must be locked to prevent resources from being changed (read access to
	 * resources is permitted).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Implementation note: The execution sequence is as follows.
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>A long-term lock on the workspace is taken out to prevent further
	 * changes to workspace until the save is done.</li>
	 * <li>The list of saveable resource tree snapshots is initially empty.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>A different <code>ISaveContext</code> object is created for each
	 * registered workspace save participant plug-in, reflecting the kind of
	 * save (<code>ISaveContext.getKind</code>), the previous save number in

	 * Advises that the caller intends to modify the contents of the given files

	 * component an opportunity to check out (or otherwise prepare) the files if
	 * required. (It is provided in this component rather than in the UI so that
	 * "core" (i.e., head-less) clients can use it. Similarly, it is located
	 * outside the VCM component for the convenience of clients that must also
	 * operate in configurations without VCM.)
	 * <p>
	 * A client (such as an editor) should perform a <code>validateEdit</code>
	 * on a file whenever it finds itself in the following position: (a) the
	 * file is marked read-only, and (b) the client believes it likely (not
	 * necessarily certain) that it will modify the file's contents at some
	 * point. A case in point is an editor that has a buffer opened on a file.
	 * When the user starts to dirty the buffer, the editor should check to see
	 * whether the file is read-only. If it is, it should call
	 * <code>validateEdit</code>, and can reasonably expect this call, when
	 * successful, to cause the file to become read-write. An editor should also
	 * be sensitive to a file becoming read-only again even after a successful
	 * <code>validateEdit</code> (e.g., due to the user checking in the file
	 * in a different view); the editor should again call
	 * <code>validateEdit</code> if the file is read-only before attempting to
	 * save the contents of the file.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * By passing a UI context, the caller indicates that the VCM component may
	 * contact the user to help decide how best to proceed. If no UI context is
	 * provided, the VCM component will make its decision without additional
	 * interaction with the user. If OK is returned, the caller can safely
	 * assume that all of the given files haven been prepared for modification
	 * and that there is good reason to believe that
	 * <code>IFile.setContents</code> (or <code>appendContents</code>)
	 * would be successful on any of them. If the result is not OK, modifying
	 * the given files might not succeed for the reason(s) indicated.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If a shell is passed in as the context, the VCM component may bring up a
	 * dialogs to query the user or report difficulties; the shell should be
	 * used to parent any such dialogs; the caller may safely assume that the
	 * reasons for failure will have been made clear to the user. If
	 * {@link IWorkspace#VALIDATE_PROMPT} is passed
	 * as the context, this indicates that the caller does not have access to
	 * a UI context but would still like the user to be prompted if required.
	 * If <code>null</code> is passed, the user should not be contacted; any
	 * failures should be reported via the result; the caller may chose to
	 * present these to the user however they see fit. The ideal implementation
	 * of this method is transactional; no files would be affected unless the
	 * go-ahead could be given. (In practice, there may be no feasible way to
	 * ensure such changes get done atomically.)
	 * </p>

	 * of the files is read-only, and a status with an <code>IStatus.OK</code>
